Marto is a well-known Pernik fighter. He has N tubes with different sizes. Marto also has M-1 friends. His friends also need tubes for fighting.
Help Marto to cut his own tubes into exactly M parts with same sizes. This size should be maximal possible (bigger tube = better fighter).

Your task is to write a program that finds the biggest possible size of the M tubes which you can cut from the initial Marto’s tubes.


Input

The input data should be read from the console.
On the first input line your program should read the integer N – the number of Marto’s tubes.
On the second input line there will be the number M – the count of the tubes Marto needs.
On the next N lines your program should read the sizes of the Marto’s tubes Marto.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.


Output

The output data should be printed on the console.
On the only output line you should print the maximal possible size of the M tubes. If it is impossible to cut the tubes with the given criteria write “-1” on the only output line.


Constraints

 N will be between 1 and 20 000, inclusive.
 M will be between 1 and 2 000 000 000, inclusive.
 The sizes of the tubes will be between 1 and 2 000 000 000, inclusive.
 Allowed working time for your
 Allowed memory: 16 MB.
